# AWS-Cloud-Detection-Lab
This lab demonstrates how the Stratus Red Team Tool by DataDog is used to simulate real-world attacks on an AWS environment and how Amazon Athenaâ€™s SQL is utilized to analyze CloudTrail logs for signs of these APT activities. Finally, the simulated attacks are mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Cloud Matrix to identify detections of cloud-based threats.
