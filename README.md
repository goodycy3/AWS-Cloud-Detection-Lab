This lab demonstrates how the <a href="https://stratus-red-team.cloud/"> Stratus Red Team Tool by Datadog </a>  is used to simulate real-world attacks on an AWS environment and how Amazon Athena‚Äôs SQL is utilized to analyze CloudTrail logs for signs of these APT activities. Finally, the simulated attacks are mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Cloud Matrix to identify detections of cloud-based threats.

                           <div style="text-align:center"> <b>Adversary Attack Workflow </b></div> 
<p>The Stratus Red Team tool simulates sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack techniques that mimic real-world adversaries. The workflow below demonstrates how this adversary simulation tool conducts automated attacks against an AWS sandbox account, thereby replicating the tactics of potential adversaries.</p>
